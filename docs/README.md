IoT devices are now a common part of any local network, both at home and in office environments. 
Their limited hardware resources, combined with a lack of proper software 
maintenance by the generally inexperienced users, and by a perception of low risk makethose devices exposed to security threats that may easily spread through the networkthey are connected to.The project will develop an application for scanning a local network for IoT devices; theapplication will produce reports according to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposuresframework. Particular weight will be given to the severity of the identified vulnerability inorder to suggest detailed steps on remedial action.
