# IoT Vulnerability Scanner

IoT devices are now a common part of any local network, both at home and in office environments. Their limited hardware resources, 
combined with a lack of proper software maintenance by the generally inexperienced users, and by a perception of low risk make 
those devices exposed to security threats that may easily spread through the network they are connected to. 

The project will develop an application for scanning a local network for IoT devices; the application will produce reports 
according to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures framework. Particular weight will be given to the severity of the identified 
vulnerability in order to suggest detailed steps on remedial action.
